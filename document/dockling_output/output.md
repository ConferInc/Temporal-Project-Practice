Line 6 . Enter only one tax form number (1040, 1065, 1120, etc.)  per request for all line 6 transcripts request types.

Line 6a . Return Transcript includes most of the line items of a tax return as filed with the IRS. A tax return transcript does not reflect changes made to the account after the return is processed. Transcripts are only available for the following returns: Form 1040 series, Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-H, Form 1120-L, and Form 1120-S. Return transcripts are available for the current year and returns processed during the prior 3 processing years.

Line 6b . Account Transcript contains information on the financial status of the account, such as payments made on the account, penalty assessments, and adjustments made by you or the IRS after the return was filed. Return information is limited to items such as tax liability and estimated tax payments. Account transcripts are available for most returns.

Line 6c . Record of Account provides the most detailed information as it is a combination of the Return Transcript and the Account Transcript. Available for current year and 3 prior tax years.

Line 7 . The IRS can provide a transcript that includes data from these information returns: Form W-2, Form 1099 series, Form 1098 series, or Form 5498 series transcript. Enter up to three information return types. If no specific type is requested, all forms will be provided. State or local information is not included with the Form W-2 information. The IRS may be able to provide this transcript information for up to 10 years. Information for the current year is generally not available until the year after it is filed with the IRS. For example, Form W-2 information for 2016, filed in 2017, will likely not be available from the IRS until 2018. If you need Form W-2 information for retirement purposes, you should contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213.

Line 8. Enter the end date of the tax year or period requested in mm dd yyyy format. This may be a calendar year, fiscal year or quarter. Enter each quarter requested for quarterly returns. Example: Enter 12 31 2018 for a calendar year 2018 Form 1040 transcript.

A bona fide shareholder of record owning 1 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the corporation may submit a Form 4506-C but must provide documentation to support the requester's right to receive the information.

Partnerships . Generally, Form 4506-C can be signed by any person who was a member of the partnership during any part of the tax period requested on line 8.

All others . See section 6103(e) if the taxpayer has died, is insolvent, is a dissolved corporation, or if a trustee, guardian, executor, receiver, or administrator is acting for the taxpayer.
