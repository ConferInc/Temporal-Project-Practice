Answer the following questions clearly and explicitly:

Source of the payload schema

From where is the payload schema derived or referenced?

Is it generated from the canonical JSON, a predefined JSON Schema, a mapping configuration, or another source?

Schema consistency across documents

Is the same payload schema used for every document type, or does it vary by document?

If it varies, explain what determines the schema selection (e.g., document type, source system, versioning).

Schema lifecycle

How and when is the payload schema validated or enforced in the extraction pipeline?

What happens if a document does not fully conform to the expected schema?

Provide the answer in a structured format with clear sections for each question.
Avoid assumptions—base your explanation only on the actual pipeline design or configuration.
